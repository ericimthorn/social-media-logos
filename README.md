#Social Media Logo's
This folder contains official social media icons from the brand-pages of the owners of the logo's.
*New logo's will be added when I need them*

The files `icons.ai` and `icons.eps` contains my 20px x 20px rendition of the logo's to place them in a list.
I tried to keep all the different style-guides in mind while keeping uniformity. I have taken some liberties. 
I have taken the SoundCloud icon form their embedded player.

In the folder `css`, there's a svg-sprite and css files created with `gulp` and `gulp-svg-sprite`.
There is no png fallback so the browser support is IE9+.
