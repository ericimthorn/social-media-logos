#Social media logo's
This folder contains official social media icons from the brand-pages of the owners of the logo's.  
*New logo's will be added when I need them*

The file `icons.eps` contains my `20px x 20px` renditions of the logo's in white.
I tried to keep all the different style-guides in mind while keeping uniformity but I have taken some liberties. 
I have taken the SoundCloud icon form their embedded player.

In the folder `css`, there are svg-sprite and css files created with `gulp` and `gulp-svg-sprite`.
There is no png fallback so the browser support is IE9+.
The project documentation can be found here:
